# Data Modeling 

**Data Modeling and Visualisation** are central to my work, particularly in **transforming normalised data tables into powerful analytical models** that support critical business decisions. By creating well-structured models, I ensure that even complex datasets become understandable and actionable, driving the business case forward.

My approach prioritises **visual storytelling**, as I believe insights are most impactful when they are easily interpretable by end users. Through **visually compelling representations**—whether using **interactive dashboards** or concise visualisations—I aim to make complex data accessible.
