We offer our team unlimited time off, 

The reason for this policy is that it's critical for PostHog that we hire people we can trust to be responsible with their time off - enough that they can recharge, but not so much that it means we don't get any work done. 



## When you should have time off

### You are sick


### childcare disasters, Jury duty / voting /  aka 'life stuff'
