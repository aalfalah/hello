I am passionate about **leveraging graph theory**, **time series analysis**, and **language models** to **model**, **understand**, and **identify changes** in user behaviour. 

By combining these advanced methods, I explore how user behaviour evolves over time, providing actionable insights that inform product decisions and drive user engagement. 

This approach involves understanding **complex user interactions**, **network effects**, and **temporal trends**, all of which contribute to more informed product development and user retention strategies.
