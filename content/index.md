My name is **Abdelkrim**. I live in SE London ðŸŽ¡, UK. I'm a happy husband and father ðŸ‘ª.

Fortunate enough to have experienced a variety of **cultures** and **contexts**, I strongly believe that **innovation's magic** operates at the **crossroads** between various disciplines. It materialises when we **assimilate patterns and frameworks** from one domain and implement them **unexpectedly** in others. This belief stems from the idea that every domain has its **own framework of thought**â€”a set of principles, practices, and approaches designed to solve specific problems. However, the drive to **maximise efficiency** often creates **silos** between domains, preventing cross-pollination of ideas.


Throughout my career, I have cultivated a deep interest in various aspects of **data analysis**, **product development**, and **startup strategy**, drawing from diverse experiences across multiple roles.These positions have shaped my understanding and approach to several key areas of expertise:

---

### Product and User Behavioural Analytics

I am passionate about **leveraging graph theory**, **time series analysis**, and **language models** to **model**, **understand**, and **identify changes** in user behaviour. By combining these advanced methods, I explore how user behaviour evolves over time, providing actionable insights that inform product decisions and drive user engagement. This approach involves understanding **complex user interactions**, **network effects**, and **temporal trends**, all of which contribute to more informed product development and user retention strategies.

### Startup & Product Growth Journey


My latest experiece In [[FACT360]] deepened my understanding of **startups** from **Go-To-Market (GTM)** strategies to **product launch**, **validation**, and achieving **Product-Market Fit (PMF)**, **startup funding**, **customer development**, and scaling products from **scratch**. Each phase of a startup's life offers unique challenges and learnings.

### Data Modeling and Visualisation

**Data Modeling and Visualisation** are central to my work, particularly in **transforming normalised data tables into powerful analytical models** that support critical business decisions. By creating well-structured models, I ensure that even complex datasets become understandable and actionable, driving the business case forward.

My approach prioritises **visual storytelling**, as I believe insights are most impactful when they are easily interpretable by end users. Through **visually compelling representations**â€”whether using **interactive dashboards** or concise visualisationsâ€”I aim to make complex data accessible.

### Experiment Design

During my research, I've had the opportunity to **deepen my understanding of experiment design** and **statistical testing**. My work frequently involved **hypothesis generation**, **sampling techniques**, and **confidence intervals** to ensure that the data supports statistically significant outcomes.

### Technology Stack

Iâ€™ve also had the opportunity to build and lead the product on top of various **tech stacks**, enhancing both my **backend** and **frontend** development skills. On the backend, Iâ€™ve worked with **Python**, **Flask**, and **databases**. On the frontend, Iâ€™ve worked and lead products built with **JavaScript** frameworks.

### Clustering Similarity Measures

Another area of focus was my research **clustering similarity measures**, where I explored how design and  experiments **to compare partitions** effectively. This work allows me to bridge **theoretical models** with **emperical experiments**.
