My name is **Abdelkrim**. I live in SE London 🎡, UK. I'm a happy husband and father 👪.

Fortunate enough to have experienced a variety of **cultures** and **contexts**, I strongly believe that **innovation's magic** operates at the **crossroads** 🛣️  between various disciplines and that it materialises when we **assimilate patterns and frameworks** from one domain and implement them **unexpectedly** in others. 


Throughout my career, I have cultivated a deep interest in various aspects of [[Advanced User Behavioural Analytics]],  [[Data Modelling for the 7 Ws]],  [[Building Data & AI Products]] , and [[Startup GTM & Growth]], [[B2B Marketing Analytics]],  and [[Discrete Mathematics Course]] drawing from diverse experiences across multiple roles. 

These positions have shaped my understanding and approach to several key areas of expertise
