Fortunate enough to have experienced a variety of **cultures** and **contexts**, I strongly believe that **innovation's magic** operates at the **crossroads** 🛣️  between various disciplines and that it materialises when we **assimilate patterns and frameworks** from one domain and implement them **unexpectedly** in others.
